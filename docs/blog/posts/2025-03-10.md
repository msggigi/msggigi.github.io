# From Jupyter Notebook to Github Pages

If your Jupyter Notebooks should not starve somewhere in your workspace, you have to publish it without the need to execute the cells of the notebook. This blog post explains a simple workflow.

## Prerequisites

* Jupyter Notebook
* Github account


## How it works step-by-step

1. Create repo

   Possibly from an jupyter notebook template
  
2. Settings to use Github Pages

   In Repo: Settings --> Pages --> Edit your branch and Deployment methods

3. Dependency

   in this example with uv
   ```
   uv add --dev ipykernel
   uv add --group deploy jupyter-book ghp-import
   ```
   
4. Creation
   
   with installation beforehand
   ```
   jb create notebook
   ```
   or without
   ```
   uv run --with jupyter-book jb create notebook
   ```
   Adapt your toc and config!

5. Building: Jupyter-book

   with installation beforehand
   ```
   jb build --path-output _build notebook/
   ```
   or without
   ```
   uv run --with jupyter-book jb build notebook
   ```

6. Deployment
   published with Github Pages script ghp-import

   ```
   ghp-import -n -p -f _build/_build/html/
   ```
